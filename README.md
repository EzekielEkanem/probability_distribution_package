# Udacity AI Programming with Python
# Project: Create a Binomial and Gaussian Distribution package using Object Oriented Programming

Author: Ezekiel Ekanem

This program creates Binomial and Gaussian Distribution package, which can be installed and used to perform probability distribution operations. 

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Uses Object-Oriented Programming to create a python package, which can be uploaded to pypi**
- [x] **Package contains code for the Gaussian and Binomial Probability Distribution Operations, including calculating mean and standard deviation of each Distribution as well as summing two or more distribution together (the two distribution must be of the same type i.e. Gaussian or Binomial Probability Distribution)**
- [x] **For the summation of two Binomial Probability Distributions, both distributions must have the same probability of outcome**
